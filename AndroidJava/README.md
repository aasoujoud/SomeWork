This is a readme file!
This is a sample of what I worked on with a partner ( I did back end coding, he did design, so basically what you see in the java file)! unfortunately the app did not go live for the company we made it for, but it works on any android app and I can show you in person! I had no prior experience in mobile app development before this and had little to no time to learn about it!

Explanation: This is one of the Tabs called "personal activity" along with its "layout", in personal activity I am taking in a bunch of input, passing it to a class (validator) and returning a value whether I should continue to the next one or not.
